# Simple, Stupid, Super, Bot
A simple IRC-bot with a plugin system. Initially it was supposed to simply fetch news from a certain site and
print to a pre-defined channel if there were any new items. As this was kind of fun it turned into a slightly larger
project, though I have no ambitions to make it 'good'.

Feel free to try it out & give ideas/pointers should you have any. Enjoy the stupid, simple, super, bot.
